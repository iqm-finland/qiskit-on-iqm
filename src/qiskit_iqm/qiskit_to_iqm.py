    Qiskit stores the results of quantum measurements in classical registers consisting of bits.
    The circuit execution results are presented as bitstrings of a certain structure so that the classical
    register and the index within that register for each bit is implied from its position in the bitstring.

    For example, if you have two classical registers in the circuit with lengths 3 and 2, then the
    measurement results will look like '01 101' if the classical register of length 3 was added to
    the circuit first, and '101 01' otherwise. If a bit in a classical register is not used in any
    measurement operation it will still show up in the results with the default value of '0'.

    To be able to handle measurement results in a Qiskit-friendly way, we need to keep around some
    information about how the circuit was constructed. This can, for example, be achieved by keeping
    around the original Qiskit quantum circuit and using it when constructing the results in
    :class:`.IQMJob`. This should be done so that the circuit is saved on the server side and not in
    ``IQMJob``, since otherwise users will not be able to retrieve results from a detached Python
    environment solely based on the job id. Another option is to use measurement key strings to
    store the required info. Qiskit does not use measurement keys, so we are free to use them
    internally in the communication with the IQM server, and can encode the necessary information in
    them.

    This class encapsulates the necessary info, and provides methods to transform between this
    representation and the measurement key string representation.
