                happen, for example, when you use pre-implemented algorithms and experiments in
                Qiskit, where the implementation of the said algorithm or experiment takes care of
                delivering correctly transpiled circuits to the backend. This callback method gives
                you a chance to look into those transpiled circuits, and extract any info you need.

        Serializing is not strictly bound to the native gateset, i.e. some gates that are not explicitly mentioned in
        the native gateset of the backend can still be serialized. For example, the native single qubit gate for IQM
        backend is the 'r' gate, however 'x', 'rx', 'y' and 'ry' gates can also be serialized since they are just
        particular cases of the 'r' gate. If the circuit was transpiled against a backend using Qiskit's transpiler
        machinery, these gates are not supposed to be present. However, when constructing circuits manually and
        submitting directly to the backend, it is sometimes more explicit and understandable to use these concrete
        gates rather than 'r'. Serializing them explicitly makes it possible for the backend to accept such circuits.

        Qiskit uses one measurement instruction per qubit (i.e. there is no measurement grouping concept). While
        serializing we do not group any measurements together but rather associate a unique measurement key with each
