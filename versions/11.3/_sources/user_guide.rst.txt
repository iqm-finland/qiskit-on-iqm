User guide
==========

This guide illustrates the main features of Qiskit on IQM. You are encouraged to run the demonstrated
code snippets and check the output yourself.

.. note::

   At the moment IQM does not provide a quantum computing service open to the general public.
   Please contact our `sales team <https://www.meetiqm.com/contact/>`_ to set up your access to an IQM quantum
   computer.


Hello, world!
-------------

Here's the quickest and easiest way to execute a small computation on an IQM quantum computer and check that
things are set up correctly:

1. Download the `bell_measure.py example file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iqm-finland/qiskit-on-iqm/f82a7a5043f4af620b84b384c7fab80c38439ecf/examples/bell_measure.py>`_ (Save Page As...)
2. Install Qiskit on IQM as instructed below (feel free to skip the import statement)
3. Install Cortex CLI and log in as instructed in the `documentation <https://iqm-finland.github.io/cortex-cli/readme.html#installing-cortex-cli>`__
4. Set the environment variable as instructed by Cortex CLI after logging in
5. Run ``$ python bell_measure.py --cortex_server_url https://demo.qc.iqm.fi/cocos`` – replace the example URL with the correct one
6. If you're connecting to a real quantum computer, the output should show almost half of the measurements resulting in '00' and almost half in '11' – if this is the case, things are set up correctly!


Installation
------------

The recommended way is to install the distribution package ``qiskit-iqm`` directly from the
Python Package Index (PyPI):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install qiskit-iqm


After installation Qiskit on IQM can be imported in your Python code as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from iqm import qiskit_iqm


Running a quantum circuit on an IQM quantum computer
----------------------------------------------------

In this section we demonstrate the practicalities of using Qiskit on IQM on an example of constructing and executing
a simple quantum circuit on an IQM quantum computer.

Let's consider the following quantum circuit which prepares and measures a GHZ state:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

    qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.cx(0, 2)
    qc.measure_all()

    print(qc.draw(output='text'))

                                     ║
    meas_2: ═════════════════════════╩═

To execute this circuit on an IQM quantum computer you need to initialize an :class:`.IQMProvider` instance
with the IQM server URL, use it to retrieve an :class:`.IQMBackend` instance representing the
quantum computer, and use Qiskit's ``execute`` function as usual:

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit import execute
    from iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMProvider

    provider = IQMProvider(iqm_server_url)
    backend = provider.get_backend()

    job = execute(qc, backend, shots=1000)

    print(job.result().get_counts())

Note that the code snippet above assumes that you have set the variable ``iqm_server_url``.

You can optionally set IQM backend specific options as additional keyword arguments to the ``execute`` method (which
passes the values down to :meth:`.IQMBackend.run`). For example, if you know an ID of a specific calibration set that
you want to use, you can provide it as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    job = execute(circuit, backend, shots=1000, calibration_set_id="f7d9642e-b0ca-4f2d-af2a-30195bd7a76d")


Alternatively, you can update the values of the options directly on the backend instance using the :meth:`.IQMBackend.set_options`
and then call execution methods without specifying additional keyword arguments. You can view all available options and
their current values using `backend.options`. Below table summarizes currently available options:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
   * - `shots`
     - Type: ``int``, Example value: ``1207``.

       Number of shots.
   * - `calibration_set_id`
     - Type: ``str``, Example value ``"f7d9642e-b0ca-4f2d-af2a-30195bd7a76d"``.

       Indicates the calibration set to use. Defaults to `None`, which means the IQM server will use the best
       available calibration set automatically.
   * - `circuit_duration_check`
     - Type: ``bool``, Example value: ``False``.

       Enable or disable server-side circuit duration checks. The default value is `True`, which means if any job is
       estimated to take unreasonably long compared to the coherence times of the qubits, or too long in wall-clock
       time, the server will reject it. This option can be used to disable this behaviour. In normal use, the
       circuit duration check should always remain enabled.
   * - `heralding_mode`
     - Type: :class:`~iqm.iqm_client.iqm_client.HeraldingMode`, Example value: ``"zeros"``.

       Heralding mode to use during execution. The default value is "none".
   * - `circuit_callback`
     - Type: :class:`collections.abc.Callable`, Example value: ``None``.

       A function that accepts a list of :class:`qiskit.QuantumCircuit` instances and does not return anything.
       When the backend receives circuits for execution, it will call this function (if provided) and pass those
       circuits as argument. This may be useful in situations when you do not have explicit control over transpilation,
       but need some information on how it was done. This can happen, for example, when you use pre-implemented
       algorithms and experiments in Qiskit, where the implementation of the said algorithm or experiment takes care of
       delivering correctly transpiled circuits to the backend. This callback method gives you a chance to look into
       those transpiled circuits, extract any info you need. As a side effect, you can also use this callback to modify
       the transpiled circuits in-place, just before execution, however we do not recommend to use it for this purpose.


If the IQM server you are connecting to requires authentication, you will also have to use
`Cortex CLI <https://github.com/iqm-finland/cortex-cli>`_ to retrieve and automatically refresh access tokens,
then set the :envvar:`IQM_TOKENS_FILE` environment variable, as instructed, to point to the tokens file.
See Cortex CLI's `documentation <https://iqm-finland.github.io/cortex-cli/readme.html>`__ for details.
Alternatively, you may authenticate yourself using the :envvar:`IQM_AUTH_SERVER`,
:envvar:`IQM_AUTH_USERNAME` and :envvar:`IQM_AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables, or pass them as
arguments to :meth:`.IQMProvider.__init__`, however this approach is less secure and considered deprecated.

The results of a job, that was executed with IQM quantum computer, contain the original request with the
qubit mapping that was used in execution. You can check this mapping once execution has finished.

.. code-block:: python

    print(job.result().request.qubit_mapping)

::

    [
      SingleQubitMapping(logical_name='0', physical_name='QB1'),
      SingleQubitMapping(logical_name='1', physical_name='QB2'),
      SingleQubitMapping(logical_name='2', physical_name='QB3')
    ]

The job also contains metadata of the execution including timestamps of the various phases of the execution.
There are timestamps for compilation start and finish and execution start and finish. The whole duration of
the job is captured in job start and job end timestamps. The timestamps can be accessed in the job results
with keys like `job_start`, `job_end`, `compile_start`, `compile_end`, `execution_start` and `execution_end`.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    print(job.result().timestamps['job_start'])
    print(job.result().timestamps['compile_start'])
    print(job.result().timestamps['execution_end'])



The ``backend`` instance we created above provides all the standard backend functionality that one expects from a
backend in Qiskit. For this example, I am connected to an IQM backend that features a 5-qubit chip with star-like
connectivity:

::

          QB1
           |
    QB2 - QB3 - QB4
           |
          QB5

Let's examine its basis gates and the coupling map through the ``backend`` instance

.. code-block:: python

    print(f'Native operations of the backend: {backend.operation_names}')
    print(f'Coupling map of the backend: {backend.coupling_map}')

::

    Native operations of the backend: ['id', 'r', 'cz', 'measure']
    Coupling map of the backend: [[0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]]

Note that for IQM backends the identiy gate ``id`` is not actually a gate that is executed on the device and is simply omitted.
At IQM we identify qubits by their names, e.g. 'QB1', 'QB2', etc. as demonstrated above. In Qiskit, qubits are
identified by their indices in the quantum register, as you can see from the printed coupling map above. Most of the
time you do not need to deal with IQM-style qubit names when using Qiskit, however when you need, the methods
:meth:`.IQMBackend.qubit_name_to_index` and :meth:`.IQMBackend.index_to_qubit_name` can become handy.

Now we can study how the circuit gets transpiled:


.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit.compiler import transpile

    qc_transpiled = transpile(qc, backend=backend, layout_method='sabre', optimization_level=3)

    print(qc_transpiled.draw(output='text'))

           meas_2: ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╩═

We also provide an optimization pass specific to the native IQM gate set which aims to reduce the number
of single-qubit gates. This optimization expects an already transpiled circuit. As an example, lets apply it to the above circuit:

.. code-block:: python

    from iqm.qiskit_iqm.iqm_transpilation import optimize_single_qubit_gates

    qc_optimized = optimize_single_qubit_gates(qc_transpiled)

    print(qc_optimized.draw(output='text'))

Under the hood :func:`optimize_single_qubit_gates` uses :class:`IQMOptimizeSingleQubitGates` which inherits from
the Qiskit provided class :class:`TransformationPass` and can also be used directly if you want to assemble
custom transpilation procedures manually.

Noisy simulation of quantum circuit execution
---------------------------------------------

The execution of circuits can be simulated locally, with a noise model to mimic the real hardware as much as possible.
To this end, Qiskit on IQM provides the class  :class:`.IQMFakeBackend` that can be instantiated with properties of a
certain QPU, or subclasses of it such as :class:`.IQMFakeAdonis` that represent certain quantum architectures with
pre-populated properties and noise model.

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit import execute, QuantumCircuit
    from iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMFakeAdonis

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    circuit.measure_all()

    backend = IQMFakeAdonis()
    job = execute(circuit, backend, shots=1000)
    job.result().get_counts()


Above, we use an :class:`.IQMFakeAdonis` instance to run a noisy simulation of ``circuit`` on a simulated 5-qubit Adonis chip.
The noise model includes relaxation (:math:`T_1`) and dephasing (:math:`T_2`), gate infidelities and readout errors.
If you want to customize the noise model instead of using the default one provided by :class:`.IQMFakeAdonis`, you can create
a copy of the fake Adonis instance with updated error profile:

.. code-block:: python

    error_profile = backend.error_profile
    error_profile.t1s['QB2'] = 30000.0  # Change T1 time of QB2 as example
    custom_fake_backend = backend.copy_with_error_profile(error_profile)

Running a quantum circuit on a facade backend
---------------------------------------------

Circuits can be executed against a mock environment: an IQM server that has no real quantum computer hardware.
Results from such executions are random bits. This may be useful when developing and testing software integrations.

Qiskit on IQM contains :class:`.IQMFacadeBackend`, which allows to combine the mock remote execution with a local
noisy quantum circuit simulation. This way you can both validate your integration as well as get an idea of the expected circuit execution results.

To run a circuit this way, use the `facade_adonis` backend retrieved from the provider. Note that the provider must be
initialized with the URL of a quantum computer with the equivalent architecture (i.e. names of qubits, their
connectivity, and the native gateset should match the 5-qubit Adonis architecture).

.. code-block:: python

    from qiskit import execute, QuantumCircuit
    from iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMProvider

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    circuit.measure_all()

    provider = IQMProvider("https://demo.qc.iqm.fi/cocos/")
    backend = provider.get_backend('facade_adonis')
    job = execute(circuit, backend, shots=1000)
    job.result().get_counts()

.. note::

   When a classical register is added to the circuit, Qiskit fills it with classical bits of value 0 by default. If the
   register is not used later, and the circuit is submitted to the IQM server, the results will not contain those
   0-filled bits. To make sure the facade backend returns results in the same format as a real IQM server,
   :meth:`.IQMFacadeBackend.run` checks for the presence of unused classical registers, and fails with an error if there
   are any.

More advanced examples
----------------------

In this section we demonstrate some less simple examples of using Qiskit on IQM and its interoperability with various
tools available in Qiskit.

It is possible to submit multiple circuits to be executed, as a batch. In many cases this is more
time efficient than running the circuits one by one. Batch execution has some restrictions: all the
circuits must measure the same qubits, and be executed for the same number of shots. For starters,
let's construct two circuits preparing and measuring different Bell states:

.. code-block:: python

    qc_1 = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc_1.h(0)
    qc_1.cx(0, 1)
    qc_1.measure_all()

    qc_2 = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc_2.h(0)
    qc_2.x(1)
    qc_2.cx(0, 1)
    qc_2.measure_all()

Now, we can execute them together in a batch:

.. code-block:: python

    job = execute([qc_1, qc_2], backend, initial_layout=[0, 2], shots=1000)
    print(job.result().get_counts())

The batch execution functionality can be used to run a parameterized circuit for various concrete values of parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qiskit.circuit import Parameter

    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    theta = Parameter('theta')
    theta_range = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 3)

    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.rz(theta, [0, 1])
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.measure_all()


    qc_transpiled = transpile(qc, backend=backend, layout_method='sabre', optimization_level=3)

    circuits = [qc_transpiled.bind_parameters({theta: n}) for n in theta_range]
    job = execute(circuits, backend, shots=1000, optimization_level=0)

    print(job.result().get_counts())

Note that it is important to transpile the parameterized circuit before binding the values to ensure a consistent qubit
measurements across circuits in the batch.
